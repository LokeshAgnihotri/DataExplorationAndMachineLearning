## About The Project


Omron uses multiple applications like Apptentive and Salesforce to collect the data about their users experience with their app and/or devices.
They want to grow as more data drive organization and for that they aim to collect their own data and refine it and get more valuable insights. 

Here's why:
* Managing the data inside the company itself, makes the data more confedential from the outside world.

* Saves the organization money by implementing ideas inside companiy insted of hiring someone else.
* Changes and updates can be made quickly and also better for custom queries that might be useful to other departments.
